# Development

## Design
![idea 1](assets/images/idea1.png "idea2")

This was the basic idea i was trying. Originally i wanted to go for a retro style game with a game input board, however i decided this was too bulky and not really easy to navigate. i decided to recreate with the idea below.
![idea 2](assets/images/idea2.png "idea1")

This is the final idea i settled with. minimalist and easy, i felt this created a more positive enviroment for people to enjoy the game.
in this i removed the input board and decided to use the central buttons instead

### Notable Design Decisions
I moved the info screen to a button press in both the main menu and in game. this was so returning users didnt need to see it every time they replayed, this also meant i could keep it there incase people needed reminding of the controls.

## Testing

### During Code Testing
![console logs](assets/images/consolelog "console log")
I consitiently used "console.log" to keep on each function, i labeled them as well so i knew at want point in the function they triggered. this helped me understand where variables where being missed.
